a) Write a python program to check if the number is prime or not. 

# Python Program to Check if a Number is Prime

# Input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Prime check
if num <= 1:
    print(num, "is not a prime number.")
else:
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number.")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number.")


b) Write a python program to find greatest of four numbers entered by user.

# Python Program to Find the Greatest of Four Numbers

# Taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter third number: "))
num4 = float(input("Enter fourth number: "))

# Finding the greatest number
greatest = max(num1, num2, num3, num4)

# Displaying the result
print("The greatest number is:", greatest)


c) Write and run a Python program that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius and converts and 
output the temperature in Fahrenheit.  

# Python Program to Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

# Taking input from the user
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Converting to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Displaying the result
print(f"The temperature in Fahrenheit is: {fahrenheit}°F")

d)Write python program to perform following operations on Lists: 
a) Create list 
b) Access list 
c) Update list (Add item, Remove item) 
d) Delete list 


# Python Program to Perform Operations on Lists

# a) Create List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
print("Original List:", fruits)

# b) Access List Elements
print("First fruit:", fruits[0])
print("Last fruit:", fruits[-1])

# c) Update List
# Adding items
fruits.append("orange")         # Adds at the end
fruits.insert(1, "grape")       # Inserts at index 1
print("After Adding Items:", fruits)

# Removing items
fruits.remove("banana")         # Removes by value
removed_item = fruits.pop()     # Removes last item
print("After Removing Items:", fruits)
print("Popped item:", removed_item)

# d) Delete List
del fruits
# print(fruits)  # This will give an error because list is deleted

print("List deleted successfully.")



(4) Here is an algorithm to print out n! (n factorial) from 0! to 19!: 
1. Set f = 1 
2. Set n = 0 
3. Repeat the following 20 times: 
a. Output n, "! = ", f 
b. Add 1 to n 
c. Multiply f by n 
Using a for loop, write and run a Python program for this algorithm.

ans :- # Python program to print factorials from 0! to 19! using a for loop

f = 1   # Step 1: Set f = 1
n = 0   # Step 2: Set n = 0

# Step 3: Repeat 20 times (from 0 to 19)
for i in range(20):
    print(f"{n}! = {f}")  # a. Output n! = f
    n += 1                # b. Add 1 to n
    f *= n                # c. Multiply f by n



(5) Modify the program above using a while loop so it prints out all of the factorial values that are 
less than 1 billion. 

# Python program to print factorials less than 1 billion using a while loop

f = 1   # Initial factorial value
n = 0   # Starting from 0!

# Loop while factorial is less than 1,000,000,000
while f < 1_000_000_000:
    print(f"{n}! = {f}")
    n += 1
    f *= n


(6) Write a python program to find the minimum in the array and find its index in the array.

# Python Program to Find Minimum Value and Its Index in an Array

# Sample array (you can modify or take input from user)
numbers = [15, 8, 42, 3, 27, 5]

# Find the minimum value
min_value = min(numbers)

# Find the index of the minimum value
min_index = numbers.index(min_value)

# Display the results
print("Array:", numbers)
print("Minimum value:", min_value)
print("Index of minimum value:", min_index)

(7) Write a python program to implement bubble sort using function. 

# Function to perform Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):  # Traverse through all elements
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):  # Last i elements are already sorted
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:  # Swap if the element found is greater
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Main program
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

print("Original array:", numbers)
bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", numbers)


(8) Write a python program to read 3 subject marks and display pass or failed using class and object. 

# Python Program to Check Pass or Fail using Class and Object

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sub1 = 0
        self.sub2 = 0
        self.sub3 = 0

    def get_marks(self):
        self.sub1 = int(input("Enter marks for Subject 1: "))
        self.sub2 = int(input("Enter marks for Subject 2: "))
        self.sub3 = int(input("Enter marks for Subject 3: "))

    def check_result(self):
        if self.sub1 >= 35 and self.sub2 >= 35 and self.sub3 >= 35:
            print("Result: PASS ✅")
        else:
            print("Result: FAIL ❌")

# Main Program
student1 = Student()
student1.get_marks()
student1.check_result()
